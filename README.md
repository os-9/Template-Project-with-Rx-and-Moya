# TemplateProject

A simple template that i made for myself to use it when i need it.

It uses Moya to organize the API calls and RxSwift to call them.

The project is still a work in progress but the APi part is already made, if you need it you can drag and drop the "API" folder and then check in "ViewModel" how to formulate the callse

(remmeber to add in pod Firebase, Moya and RxSwift)
